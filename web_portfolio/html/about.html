    <p>Hello World! My name is Zachary. I'm a creative, passionate, and dedicated individual.
        I have a keen eye for detail and a strong work ethic.
        I enjoy learning about new technologies and how they can impact our lives.    
        I'm currently an Innovative Business Partner at a financial institution.
        Previously, I've served in the military and have a Bachelors in Computer Science.
        Though a degree in Computer Science is not required, it opened up doors to my passion for programming. Explore my page to learn more about me.
